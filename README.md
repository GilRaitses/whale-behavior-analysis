# Whale Behavior Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains interactive visualizations and reports analyzing marine mammal diving behavior patterns. The analysis uses a variety of visualization techniques to classify different behavior types including side rolls, exploratory dives, kick feeding, and more.

## Contents
- Interactive dive profile visualizations showing behavior-specific depth patterns
- 3D energy expenditure visualization with both scatter and surface plot capabilities
- t-SNE dimensionality reduction visualizations showing behavior clustering and energy patterns
- Detailed dive analysis reports in HTML and Markdown formats
- Comprehensive behavior classification of 7 distinct diving behaviors

## Visualizations

### Dive Profiles Visualization
Shows detailed dive profiles for each behavior type, with options to:
- Filter by specific behaviors
- View all dives simultaneously
- Stack dives for easier comparison
- Align dives at the surface

### 3D Energy Visualization
Displays energy expenditure in relation to dive depth and time:
- 3D scatter plot colored by behavior type
- 3D surface plot showing energy hotspots
- Interactive filtering and rotation capabilities

### t-SNE Visualizations
Two complementary t-SNE visualizations:
1. **Enhanced t-SNE by Behavior Type**: Shows the clustering of different diving behaviors
2. **Energy t-SNE**: Displays energy expenditure patterns across behavior clusters
