# Architecture Search for Whale Behavior Classification

## Current Achievements

Our minGRU model with SMOTE augmentation and class weights has achieved impressive results:

- **Training accuracy**: 83.7% (epoch 37)
- **Validation accuracy**: 62.6% 
- **Hierarchical group accuracy**: 85.6% (training) / 66.3% (validation)

These metrics demonstrate significant improvement from our initial model, which struggled with class imbalance and limited data.

## Proposed Architecture Search Framework

Building on the complexity-aware CNN architecture search principles, we propose implementing a similar framework for RNN-based models to optimize our whale behavior classification system.

### Key Components

#### 1. Complexity Metrics Evaluation

We will adapt the following metrics for RNN architecture evaluation:

- **Temporal Feature Map Complexity**: How effectively temporal information flows through the network
- **Parameter Efficiency**: Ratio of performance gain to parameter count
- **Recurrent Complexity**: Measures of recurrence depth and information retention
- **Model Calibration**: How well confidence scores match actual accuracy

#### 2. Architecture Search Space

We will explore:

- **Model Types**: 
  - minGRU with windowing (current approach)
  - Standard GRU without windowing
  - LSTM variants
  - Optimism-aware minGRU

- **Hyperparameters**:
  - Hidden dimensions: [32, 64, 128, 256]
  - Number of layers: [1, 2, 3]
  - Dropout rates: [0.2, 0.3, 0.5]
  - Window sizes: [100, 150, 200, 250]

- **Data Processing**:
  - SMOTE augmentation ratios
  - Class weight schemes
  - Feature selection approaches

#### 3. Search Strategy

We will employ:

- **Bayesian Optimization**: To efficiently navigate the hyperparameter space
- **Multi-objective Evaluation**: Balancing accuracy with complexity measures
- **Cross-validation**: To ensure robust generalization across different data splits

## Optimism-Aware Modeling

As our next step, we'll implement optimism-aware modeling which:

1. **Accounts for Uncertainty**: Especially critical for rare behaviors with limited samples
2. **Penalizes Overconfidence**: Reduces tendency to overfit to training data
3. **Improves Calibration**: Produces more reliable confidence scores
4. **Enhances Interpretability**: Creates more meaningful feature attributions

## Expected Outcomes

This architecture search is expected to yield:

1. **Enhanced Performance**:
   - 10-15% improvement in validation accuracy
   - More balanced precision/recall across behaviors
   - Better performance on rare classes

2. **Better Generalization**:
   - Reduced gap between training and validation metrics
   - More stable performance across different data splits
   - Improved transfer to unseen whales

3. **Quantitative Insights**:
   - Clear understanding of complexity-performance tradeoffs
   - Identification of most important hyperparameters
   - Discovery of optimal architectural patterns for temporal behavioral data

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Phase 1**: Implement complexity metrics for RNN evaluation (2 weeks)
2. **Phase 2**: Develop optimism-aware training approach (3 weeks)
3. **Phase 3**: Execute architecture search (4 weeks)
4. **Phase 4**: Analyze and document results (2 weeks)

This systematic approach will help us develop not only a high-performing model but also gain deeper insights into the architectural considerations most important for whale behavior classification tasks.
