# Whale Behavior Classification Pipeline

## Pipeline Overview

The whale behavior classification system consists of a multi-stage pipeline that processes raw sensor data from tagged whales and classifies behaviors into nine distinct categories. Key performance metrics from our latest training run (56 epochs):

- **Training accuracy**: 91.4% (from 17.8% at epoch 1)
- **Validation accuracy**: 66.8% (from 28.3% at epoch 1)
- **Hierarchical group accuracy**: 92.4% training / 70.6% validation

## 1. Data Loading and Preprocessing

### Role
The pipeline begins by loading dive data from HDF5 files containing multi-dimensional sensor readings from tagged whales.

```
Loading data from ../data/dive_analysis.h5
Available keys in the data file: ['analysis', 'annotations', 'behaviors', 'data', 'depth', 'dives', 'dr', 'eti']
```

### Implementation
- The system reads structured data from H5 files, containing raw sensor readings, annotations, and behavior classifications
- File structure is analyzed to identify available sensors and metadata
- Data is organized into a standardized format with timestamps aligned across all sensors

### Impact
From the logs, we can see the system successfully loads multiple sensor types (accelerometer, magnetometer, pressure sensors):
```
'data' is a group with keys: ['A.1', 'A.2', 'A.3', 'Aw.1', 'Aw.2', 'Aw.3', 'M.1', 'M.2', 'M.3', 'Mw.1', 'Mw.2', 'Mw.3', 'head', 'pitch', 'pressure', 'roll', 'sample_idx', 'tempr']
```

## 2. Feature Extraction

### Role
Raw sensor data is transformed into meaningful features that capture the dynamics of whale behavior.

### Implementation
- Statistical features (mean, std, min, max) are computed from raw sensor channels
- Derived features like acceleration magnitude are calculated
- Domain-specific features like vertical velocity are computed through integration

### Impact
The system creates a rich feature representation with 20 dimensions:
```
Number of features: 20
Successfully built feature matrix with shape: (99925, 20)
```

Features include (from logs):
```
Loaded feature 'roll_std' from 'roll'
Calculated feature 'calculated_roll_std' from 'roll'
Loaded feature 'Aw.3_mean' from 'Aw.3'
...
Calculated acceleration magnitude feature 'acceleration_magnitude_max'
...
Calculated velocity feature 'vertical_velocity_min' by integrating A.3
```

## 3. Behavior Labeling and Class Mapping

### Role
Maps annotated behaviors to numerical classes for model training.

### Implementation
- Extracts behavior types from the dataset
- Maps text annotations to specific behavior classes
- Creates a consistent numerical class mapping

### Impact
The system successfully identified 9 specific behavior classes plus an unlabeled class:
```
Behavior class mapping:
  Class 1: Exploratory_dives
  Class 2: Feeding_loop
  Class 3: Kick_feeding
  Class 4: Noodle_feeding
  Class 5: Side_rolls
  Class 6: Side_rolls_and_loop
  Class 7: Surface_Active
  Class 8: Traveling
  Class 9: Vertical_loop
  Class 0: Unlabeled
```

Initial class distribution showed severe imbalance:
```
  Class 1: 216 windows (36.06%)
  Class 2: 34 windows (5.68%)
  Class 3: 53 windows (8.85%)
  Class 4: 114 windows (19.03%)
  Class 5: 112 windows (18.70%)
  Class 6: 15 windows (2.50%)
  Class 7: 33 windows (5.51%)
  Class 8: 16 windows (2.67%)
  Class 9: 6 windows (1.00%)
```

## 4. Sliding Window Creation

### Role
Segments continuous time series data into fixed-length windows for classification.

### Implementation
- Creates overlapping windows of sensor data
- Associates each window with the corresponding behavior label
- Filters out windows with unlabeled data

### Impact
The window creation process produced 599 windows of labeled behaviors after filtering unlabeled data. This step transforms the continuous time series into discrete samples for classification.

## 5. SMOTE Augmentation

### Role
Addresses class imbalance by generating synthetic examples for minority classes.

### Implementation
- Custom time series SMOTE implementation for multi-class data
- Generates synthetic samples through interpolation between real samples
- Adds small noise (5%) to enhance realism

### Impact
SMOTE successfully balanced all classes to approximately 129 samples each:
```
Original class distribution:
  Class 1: 216 windows
  Class 2: 34 windows
  Class 3: 53 windows
  Class 4: 114 windows
  Class 5: 112 windows
  Class 6: 15 windows
  Class 7: 33 windows
  Class 8: 16 windows
  Class 9: 6 windows

Augmented class distribution:
  Class 1: 216 windows (+0 from original)
  Class 2: 129 windows (+95 from original)
  Class 3: 129 windows (+76 from original)
  Class 4: 129 windows (+15 from original)
  Class 5: 129 windows (+17 from original)
  Class 6: 129 windows (+114 from original)
  Class 7: 129 windows (+96 from original)
  Class 8: 129 windows (+113 from original)
  Class 9: 129 windows (+123 from original)
```

Most critically, for the rarest class (Vertical_loop) with only 6 original samples, SMOTE generated 123 synthetic samples.

## 6. Class Weighting

### Role
Further addresses class imbalance by making the model more sensitive to rare classes.

### Implementation
- Computes class weights inversely proportional to class frequency
- Ignores unlabeled class (Class 0) by setting its weight to 0
- Applies weights to loss function during training

### Impact
Class weights were successfully applied, with higher weights for rare classes:
```
Class weights:
  Class 0: 0.0000
  Class 1: 0.6258
  Class 2: 1.1279
  Class 3: 1.0430
  Class 4: 1.0778
  Class 5: 1.1023
  Class 6: 1.1279
  Class 7: 1.0543
  Class 8: 1.0211
  Class 9: 1.1023
```

This ensured that errors on rare classes like Vertical_loop had a stronger impact on the loss function.

## 7. Hierarchical Behavior Grouping

### Role
Creates a higher-level organizational structure for behaviors, allowing evaluation at both specific behavior and group levels.

### Implementation
- Maps individual behaviors to higher-level groups (Feeding, Movement, Exploratory, Surface)
- Calculates group-level accuracy metrics
- Provides additional insights into model performance

### Impact
The hierarchical grouping improved interpretability and showed higher accuracy:
```
Hierarchical behavior grouping:
  Feeding:
    - Feeding_loop (Class 2)
    - Kick_feeding (Class 3)
    - Noodle_feeding (Class 4)
    - Vertical_loop (Class 9)
  Movement:
    - Side_rolls (Class 5)
    - Side_rolls_and_loop (Class 6)
    - Traveling (Class 8)
  Exploratory:
    - Exploratory_dives (Class 1)
  Surface:
    - Surface_Active (Class 7)
  Unlabeled:
    - Unlabeled (Class 0)
```

Group accuracy consistently outperformed raw accuracy (e.g., 70.6% vs 66.8% at epoch 56), indicating the model often makes "sensible" errors within the same behavioral category.

## 8. Model Architecture (minGRU)

### Role
Processes temporal patterns in the windowed sensor data to classify behaviors.

### Implementation
- Uses minimal Gated Recurrent Unit (minGRU) architecture
- Processes fixed-length windows of multi-dimensional time series
- Outputs classification probabilities for each behavior class

### Impact
The minGRU architecture proved effective, with the model containing 39,690 trainable parameters:
```
Model parameters: 39690
```

## 9. Parallelization

### Role
Accelerates training by utilizing multiple processing units simultaneously.

### Implementation
- Leverages Apple Silicon GPU through MPS (Metal Performance Shaders) backend
- Implements parallel data loading and processing
- Uses parallel execution of neural network operations

### Impact
The training logs show successful utilization of Apple Silicon GPU:
```
Using Apple Silicon GPU via MPS backend
```

Each epoch completed in approximately 45 seconds (25s for training, 19s for validation), demonstrating efficient parallel processing.

## 10. Training Process

### Role
Optimizes model parameters to minimize classification error while preventing overfitting.

### Implementation
- Uses mini-batch gradient descent with Adam optimizer
- Implements early stopping and model checkpointing
- Tracks multiple metrics (loss, accuracy, group accuracy)

### Impact
Training progressed steadily, with improving metrics over time:
```
Epoch 1/100: Train Loss: 2.2204, Train Acc: 0.1775, Val Loss: 2.1257, Val Acc: 0.2834
Group Accuracy: Train: 0.3585, Val: 0.4652
...
Epoch 56/100: Train Loss: 0.2952, Train Acc: 0.9141, Val Loss: 1.1669, Val Acc: 0.6684
Group Accuracy: Train: 0.9244, Val: 0.7059
```

Training accuracy improved dramatically from 17.8% to 91.4%, while validation accuracy more than doubled from 28.3% to 66.8%. The system automatically saved the best model when validation performance improved.

## 11. Impact Assessment of Each Method
